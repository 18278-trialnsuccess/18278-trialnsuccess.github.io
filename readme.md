# Trial N Success

We are an FTC robotics team located in Concord, North Carolina that is a sister team of 16328 Trial N’ Error. Many of the members of our team were on that team and won states, qualifying for worlds. We are looking to match that achievement this year with Trial N’ Success, being a large part of our community along the way.
